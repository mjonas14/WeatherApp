# WeatherApp

## Description

Link to application: https://mjonas14.github.io/WeatherApp/

Following the link will bring you to my Weather Forecast webpage. The webpage is useful for looking at weather data, both for today as well as for a 5-day forecast

## Usage

The usage of the website is simple. The user is able to search for a city in the search field, and upon clicking "Search", the weather data will populate, with today's date in the main box and a five day foreward looking forecast below. Each weather card has the date, the temperature, the wind and the humidity, as well as an icon representing the weather. The user's search history is saved beneath the search field, and is removed when the page is refreshed. 

## Credits

This application utlizes OpenWeather's API to obtain weather data. A link to their website follows, https://openweathermap.org/.

Code to obtain the icon in the 5 day forecast was found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44177417/how-to-display-openweathermap-weather-icon.
